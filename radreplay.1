.SH NAME
radreplay \- Radius testing tool using pcap captures
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B radreplay
[options]
-f 
.I pcap_file
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B radreplay
reads files generated by
.B libpcap
looking for radius packets. Once it's found a response packet, it looks in it's cache for the request that it is in response to. It then sends that request to a nominated radius server, and checks the response it receives against the original response in the pcap file. It then prints a message out with the results of the check. If there are differences in the attributes these are also printed in a human readable format.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP -d
Enables debug output,
.B very noisy!
.IP "-r radius_dictionary_file"
Use the nominated radius dictionary.
.IP "-s server_address"
Set the server to send the packets to to
.I server_address.
This is 127.0.0.1 by default
.IP "-p server_port"
Set the port to send packets to to
.I server_port.
This is 1812 by default.
.IP "-i ignore_string"
Ignore attribures in the given string. The format should be: Attribute-One[:Attribute2] ...
.SH EXIT STATUS
.B radreplay
exits 0 on success, and non-zero on failure.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
No specific environment variables are used, other than
.B $HOME
which is used to locate the user's config file.
.SH FILES
.IP ~/.radreplayrc
Default config file.
.IP /etc/radreplay.conf
Global config file.
.SH NOTES
.B radreplay
currently only supports the following radius packets:
Access-Request,
Access-Accept,
Access-Reject.

The captures that radreplay read through
.B MUST
have the responses captured as well as the requests, otherwise radreplay won't send anything out as it has nothing to compare the responses it gets to.
The computer you run radreplay from
.B MUST
have the same shared secret on the server you are sending to as the clients that originally send the packets.
.SH BUGS
No known bugs
.SH EXAMPLE
radreplay -f /tmp/radcapture.pcap -s 1.2.3.4

This would read through the packets stored in
.I /tmp/radcapture.pcap
and send them to
.I 1.2.3.4
then compare the response with the original response in /tmp/radcapture.pcap.
